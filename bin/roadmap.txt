1a) Working static environment collision against ICollidable implementations,
	- Hierachical Bounding Spheres  (A3D7/A3D8 Scene graph to hierchical BoundingSpheres)  
	- Hierchical Bounding Boxes     (A3D7/A3D8 Scene graph to hierchical BoundingBoxes) 	(this can recurse into child ICollidable instances )
    - BSP Geometry                  (A3d7 BSPContainer to BSP tree of geometries) - great for non-axis-aligned cities/indoors and such. Can be streamed in.
    - KD Geometry                   (A3d7 KDContainer to KD tree of geometries) - great for axis-aligned cities and such. Can be streamed in. Can recurse into ICollidable instead.
	- A3D8 Quadtree terrain          (QuadSquareChunks to on-the-fly generated geometries)  *  
1b) ( and ray detection IRayIntersectable:)

2) Milkshape to A3d7 to A3D8. Milkshape to animations for A3D8. *
3) Working upper/lower body controllers and animation for characters (A3D) *  (test on simple plane floor (box room geometry) first before going to quadtree terrain)
